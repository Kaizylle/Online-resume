    <h2>These are things that bring me joy outside of work:
    <hr>
    <h3>Music Production</h3>
    <p>For more than 12 years, I produced music, self teaching myself instruments and mimicking styles from icons like Michael Jackson, Prince, Jodeci, and many more. You can <a href="https://www.solo.to/kaizylle">click here</a> to go through my discography.</p>
     <hr>
    <h3>Film Production</h3>
    <p>Music is one of my greatest talents, and film production just further expands what I can do sonically and visually. I am still beginning in with this, but plan to make this my second greatest talent.</p>
     <hr>
    <h3>Game Development</h3>
    <p>I've been learning Blender, Unreal Engine, and Unity on and off, but I have made some success with this. </p>
     <hr>
    <h3>Sightseeing</h3>
    <p>It's nothing better than watching the sun set behind a beautiful scenery of trees and elevation with the people you love. Or just going to some aesthetic cemetery or forest and kicking it with your group.</p>
     <hr>
    <h3>Pool</h3>
    <p>I won't put money o it, but I <i><b>BET</b></i> I could beat you at some pool. Don't let my boy Jaden get on the table. USE THE STICK!</p>
